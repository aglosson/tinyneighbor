# Tiny Neighbor üè°

This is a place for [me](http://www.twitter.com/amandaglosson) to build out my long-term passion project of randomly generating houses.

I've taken many different approaches/libraries/styles and my latest attempt will be using POV-Ray. POV-Ray is going to be able to effortlessly provide me with some utilities that are very important to me with this project:
- The ability to define house parts within my development environment (as opposed to building models or drawing images externally and then importing them)
- The ability to provide very nice lighting (night/day, holiday lighting...)

The now deprecated version of [@tinyNeighbor](http://www.twitter.com/tinyneighbor) is a pixel art bot, which I love the aesthetic of, but I was finding it far too difficult to create shadows and shapes that interacted with each other in a nice way. Until this new version gets off the ground, I'll be leaving the old version running.
