# Tiny Neighbor üè°

This is a place for [me](http://www.twitter.com/amandaglosson) to share and stash the [Tracery](http://tracery.io/) code behind my growing Twitter bot, [@tinyneighbor](http://www.twitter.com/tinyneighbor), while also providing a changelog and screenshots.

The bot itself is being hosted at [cheapbotsdonequick.com](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/), which is, as advertised, a very quick and easy way to create a fun bot and launch it out into the world.
